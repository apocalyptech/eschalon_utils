Packaging
---------
 * Should do the packaging and class stuff properly; install into the
   Python library dir, etc.
 * Windows / OSX packaging

Data
----
 * Figure out the rest of our unknown values
 * Figure out our unknown item types
 * Figure out what other bit flags there might be ("visibility" probably
   isn't just an int)
 * Figure out details of the visual effects values (some of that is
   probably bit flags as well)
 * Figure out where in the world current-map and actual position information
   is kept (aha!  this is in 'saveneme' I bet.  I suspect that quest status is
   also kept in there...)

Character GUI
-------------
 * Implement the "Unknowns" screen
 * Highlight the Inventory Notebook labels when there's a change in one
   of them
 * Support old AND new Tooltip style, so this doesn't break with PyGTK 3.0
 * Mouseover notification of previous values (for changed values)
 * Figure out default save file location on Windows/Cygwin/Darwin, and how
   to get at them
 * (and CLI, actually) - show some more useful messages when a file can't
   be loaded
 * Confirmation of close when the window is destroyed (via the close button,
   for instance)
 * Figure out implications of not rigorously checking gamedir on prefs screen
   (loading new maps, etc...)

Map GUI
-------
 * Separate thread to pre-cache tiles in map editor, for "instantaneous" state
   flips?
 * We shouldn't *always* put our black tile in-place.  For instance, when the
   tile is decorative over a cliff, etc (see to.map).  So we should
   special-case that.
 * Some graphical glitches can occur when changing objects, apparently related
   to some pixels from objects which were drawn JUST on the edge of the tile,
   which end up getting drawn technically outside the bounds of the tile (this
   leaves some pixels here and there - notice this on the tallest tree tile
   (northeast 35 is a good place to see it) or on the big granite blocks
   outside Grimmhold (northwest 35)
 * Status bars for functions aren't basically instantaneous
 * Confirmation on close when there's been changes
 * Warning/abort if trying to edit square with an unknown entity
 * Check for luminosity...  Light in square in Blackwater, for instance
 * Cloud overlay stuff?  Like in Vela?
 * Implement a 'question mark' or something for invalid tiles/entities
 * Should the 'friendly' field just be a checkbox?
 * Dragging to move map
 * Dropdown/textbox things for map names, sound files, etc.
 * Bigger textboxes in general on the entity edit window (and perhaps
   elsewhere in there) 

Internal
--------
 * We're doubly-caching some widgets in the GUI code, which is stupid.
   Should consolidate those.
 * A whole lot of code-cleaning should really be done (separate ImgSize to
   class, etc)
 * Enforce a strict .get_value_as_int() for changed int values - will have
   to set up a new signal for weight on items.  I think that's our one actual
   float value.
 * Convert all objects to "new-style" objects?
