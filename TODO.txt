Packaging
---------
 * Should do the packaging and class stuff properly; install into the
   Python library dir, etc.
 * Windows / OSX packaging

Data
----
 * Figure out the rest of our unknown values
 * Figure out our unknown item types
 * Figure out what other bit flags there might be ("visibility" probably
   isn't just an int)
 * Figure out details of the visual effects values (some of that is
   probably bit flags as well)

GUI
---
 * Implement the "Unknowns" screen
 * Highlight the Inventory Notebook labels when there's a change in one
   of them
 * Support old AND new Tooltip style, so this doesn't break with PyGTK 3.0
 * Mouseover notification of previous values (for changed values)
 * Figure out default save file location on Windows/Cygwin/Darwin, and how
   to get at them
 * (and CLI, actually) - show some more useful messages when a file can't
   be loaded
 * Confirmation of close when the window is destroyed (via the close button,
   for instance)
 * Item Library - pick from objects available in the game
 * Make sure Profile Picture lookup is okay when there's no custom image
 * Preferences dialog (game data, save locations)
 * Something on the item icon selection dialog will make it disappear and be
   very slow...

Internal
--------
 * We're doubly-caching some widgets in the GUI code, which is stupid.
   Should consolidate those.
 * Make sure that map-writing actually works
