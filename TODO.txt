Packaging
---------
 * Should do the packaging and class stuff properly; install into the
   Python library dir, etc.
 * Windows / OSX packaging

Data
----
 * Figure out the rest of our unknown values
 * Figure out our unknown item types
 * Figure out what other bit flags there might be ("visibility" probably
   isn't just an int)
 * Figure out details of the visual effects values (some of that is
   probably bit flags as well)

GUI
---
 * Implement the "Unknowns" screen
 * New/Open/SaveAs functionality (though, really, "New" might not make sense)
 * Implement "About" screen
 * Highlight the Inventory Notebook labels when there's a change in one
   of them
 * Notification that the last inventory slot is probably unused by Eschalon
 * Support old AND new Tooltip style, so this doesn't break with PyGTK 3.0
 * Confirmation of close when there's unsaved changes
 * Mouseover notification of previous values (for changed values)

Internal
--------
 * We're doubly-caching some widgets in the GUI code, which is stupid.
   Should consolidate those.
