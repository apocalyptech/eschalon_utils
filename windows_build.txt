To build on Windows
-------------------

Requirements:

  * GTK+/Python/PyGTK (app should be runnable as Python scripts)
  * cx_Freeze
  * Inno Setup Compiler

Process:

    1) To avoid having to change paths in win-inno.iss, copy to
       C:\InstPrograms\eschalon_utils

    2) From a DOS cmd, run "win-setup.py build_exe"

    3) Copy everything from inside build/exe.win32-2.6 to dist/
       (which is where win-setup.py put some .exe and .zip files)

    4) Copy data/ to dist/

    5) Right-click on win-inno.iss and choose "Compile"

You should be left with a nice self-contained EXE in Output/
